|----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | Real-Time Text Summarization              | As a user, I want the extension to summarize the webpage I'm currently reading.                            | When activated, the extension should parse the visible text and generate a real-time summary using an NLP model/API.                                            |
| FR002          | Section-Wise Summaries                    | As a user, I want to get summaries for individual sections or paragraphs.                                  | The extension should detect structure (e.g., headers or paragraphs) and allow summary toggles per section.                                                      |
| FR003          | TL;DR Button                              | As a user, I want a simple TL;DR button that gives me a quick overview of the whole page.                  | A floating or pinned button should generate a concise 1-2 paragraph summary of the entire page.                                                                 |
| FR004          | Q&A Quiz Mode                             | As a user, I want a short quiz based on what I read so I can test my understanding.                        | After summarizing, the extension should auto-generate 2‚Äì3 short questions (MCQ/short answer) based on the content.                                              |
| FR005          | Retention Tracker                         | As a user, I want to track how well I do in these quizzes over time.                                       | The system should store quiz scores locally (or in Firebase if synced) and display insights like retention score or accuracy trends.                           |
| FR006          | Highlight + Explain                       | As a user, I want to highlight a confusing sentence or term and get a simplified explanation.              | Right-click or select text and choose ‚ÄúExplain‚Äù from the context menu ‚Äî the extension should give a plain English explanation (possibly via an LLM).            |
| FR007          | Topic Bookmarking                         | As a user, I want to save pages or topics I‚Äôve summarized so I can revisit or review them later.           | The extension should include a dashboard or popup view showing saved articles with summaries and quiz scores.                                                   |
| FR008          | Offline Summarization                     | As a user, I want to summarize documents even when I'm not connected to the internet.                      | The extension should support offline summarization with a local ML model or provide a message when offline-only mode is unavailable.                           |
| FR009          | PDF Support                               | As a user, I want to use this extension to summarize PDFs (like arXiv papers).                             | If a user opens a PDF in-browser, the extension should extract text and summarize it using the same summarization flow.                                        |
| FR010          | Model Options                             | As a user, I want to choose from different summarization styles (technical, casual, key points, etc).      | Provide a dropdown or settings panel with modes (e.g., Technical, Plain English, Bullet Points).                                                               |
| FR011          | UI: Sticky Widget or Popup                | As a user, I want a non-intrusive, easily accessible UI while reading.                                     | A collapsible widget or Chrome popup should provide access to summaries, quiz, and bookmarks without covering content.                                          |
| FR012          | Dark Mode / Theme Matching                | As a user, I want the extension to match the site‚Äôs theme or support dark mode.                            | Extension should detect theme or offer manual toggle for light/dark UI.                                                                                        |
| FR013          | Analytics (Optional / Opt-in)             | As a user, I want to see usage stats (how many articles read, avg quiz score, etc).                        | If enabled, the extension should provide a dashboard view of personal usage insights (summaries read, topics revisited, etc.).                                  |
| FR014          | Export Summaries & Scores                 | As a user, I want to export my summaries or quiz performance.                                               | Provide export options as markdown, plain text, or PDF.                                                                                                        |
| FR015          | Privacy First / No Logging by Default     | As a privacy-conscious user, I want control over what‚Äôs stored or sent.                                    | The extension should not store data unless explicitly permitted. No logging without opt-in.                                                                   |

Would you like a:
- Svelte + Manifest V3 boilerplate starter?
- API suggestion (like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 / Groq + Llama3) for the summarizer?
- Local model option via WebLLM or ONNX runtime?

Just say the word and I‚Äôll wire it up üîß
