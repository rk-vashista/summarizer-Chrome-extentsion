Here’s a detailed **Best Practices Document** for your **"What Did I Just Read?" Chrome Extension** project, covering everything from architecture to development and deployment:

---

# 📘 **Best Practices Document**
### Project: **"What Did I Just Read?" Summarizer + Quiz Chrome Extension**

---

## 1. 🏗️ Project Structure & Architecture

### ✅ Modularize by Feature
Organize the codebase into **clearly scoped modules**:
```
src/
│
├── background/         # Background scripts
├── content/            # Content scripts for scraping, parsing
├── popup/              # Popup UI components
├── summarizer/         # LLM API interactions
├── quiz/               # Quiz logic & quiz components
├── storage/            # Local or Firebase storage wrappers
├── utils/              # Utility functions
├── assets/             # Icons, badges, etc.
└── manifest.json
```

### ✅ Use TypeScript Everywhere
- Strongly type all LLM responses, quiz schemas, and summaries.
- Create shared `types.ts` across modules.

---

## 2. 🧩 UI & UX

### ✅ SvelteKit + TailwindCSS
- Keep components small and reusable.
- Use `@apply` for common utility classes.
- Use `:global()` sparingly and always with naming context.

### ✅ Dark Mode
- Add dark/light theme toggle using Tailwind’s `dark:` variant.
- Respect system preference by default.

---

## 3. 📦 Chrome Extension Dev (Manifest V3)

### ✅ Use `CRXJS` for Svelte bundling
- Maintains hot reloads & easy production builds.
- Ensures compatibility with MV3 service workers.

### ✅ Minimal Permissions
- Ask only for necessary permissions (`activeTab`, `scripting`, `storage`, etc.).
- Avoid `host_permissions` unless absolutely required.

### ✅ Service Worker Lifecycle
- Keep it **stateless** and fast.
- Offload tasks to background tasks or content scripts if long-running.

---

## 4. 🧠 Summarization Engine

### ✅ Caching
- Store recent summaries locally (IndexedDB) to avoid repeated API calls.
- Optionally expire cache after X hours.

### ✅ Model Selection
- Use GPT-4-turbo for best retention questions and summaries.
- Use Groq + LLaMA 3 when performance and speed matter.
- Abstract models into a `summarizer.ts` layer for easy swaps.

### ✅ Rate Limiting & Throttling
- Batch content and summarize in chunks.
- Respect token limits (e.g., split large PDFs or long HTML).

---

## 5. 📄 Parsing & Cleanup

### ✅ Use `Readability.js` for web articles
- Strip out ads, sidebars, comments.
- Keep metadata (title, site, author) for quiz context.

### ✅ Use `pdf.js` carefully
- Preprocess PDFs only on user request.
- Add progress bars for large files.

---

## 6. 📚 Quiz Mode

### ✅ GPT-Powered Q&A
- Use `prompt templates` to guide GPT to generate short MCQs or flashcard-style questions.
- Example:
```txt
Given this summary, create 2 questions to test retention. Keep answers short.
```

### ✅ Local Scoring System
- Track how many quizzes taken, correct answers, quiz difficulty.
- Store in IndexedDB as:
```ts
{
  summaryId: string,
  correct: number,
  total: number,
  date: string
}
```

---

## 7. 💾 Data & Storage

### ✅ IndexedDB with a wrapper
- Use `idb-keyval` or custom utility wrapper.
- Key structure example:
  ```
  summary:{hash}
  quiz:{hash}
  badge:{type}
  ```

### ✅ Cloud Sync (Optional)
- Use Firebase Auth + Firestore if user wants sync.
- Always ask for consent before cloud storage.

---

## 8. 📤 Export & Sharing

### ✅ PDF/Image Export
- Use `html2pdf.js` or `dom-to-image` to export clean, styled summary views.
- Compress before download using `pdf-lib`.

---

## 9. 📊 Analytics

### ✅ Chart + Heatmap
- Store summary/quiz streaks in local DB and map them visually.
- Use `Chart.js` or `Recharts` for score trends.
- Use `heatmap.js` or D3 to replicate GitHub-style activity map.

---

## 10. 🏆 Gamification

### ✅ Badge Logic
Use a badge schema like:
```ts
{
  id: "perfect-week",
  unlocked: true,
  dateUnlocked: "2025-04-15"
}
```

Examples:
- 🎯 **“Perfect Week”**: 7-day streak
- 💡 **“Quiz Champ”**: 10 quizzes in a day
- 📚 **“Arxiv Addict”**: 5 papers summarized

Track badges using state machines or rule checks post-action.

---

## 11. 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Use Vitest + Playwright
- Write component tests for UI.
- Use Playwright to simulate extension flows (popup → summarize → quiz).

---

## 12. 🚀 Deployment

### ✅ Extension Build
- `pnpm build:crx` (or npm)
- Validate manifest with Chrome Web Store tools.
- Zip and submit via Chrome Developer Dashboard.

---

## 13. 🔒 Security

- Sanitize all HTML before injecting into summary views.
- Never expose API keys in frontend – use proxy server if needed.
- Implement CSP (Content Security Policy) to prevent XSS.
